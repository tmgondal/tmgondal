### ðŸ”­ My Educational Background<br>
Engr. Taimoor Muzaffar Gondal did his Master of Electrical Engineering degree from COMSATS University Islamabad, Lahore Campus, Pakistan. He did his Bachelors of Electrical Engineering from COMSATS Institute of Information Technology, Wah Campus (Currently known as COMSATS University Islamabad, Wah Campus).

### ðŸ”­ Education	<br>
2019-2021	MS in Electrical Engineering<br>
COMSATS University Islamabad, Lahore Campus Pakistan<br>
CGPA: 3.43/4.0 <br>
Thesis Title: Anomaly Detection and Load Forecasting in Short Term Electric Loads using Machine Learning Algorithms. <br>

Short Abstract: In this thesis, an anomaly detection model and a short-term load forecasting-based model have been developed. Initially, anomaly detection has been implemented on electrical load for the data of duration three years. The LSTM model is trained and used to predict the electrical load and the mean square error is computed on test data. Based on maximum observed error, a threshold is selected to detect anomalies in the total data. After anomaly detection, the short-term load forecasting is performed using LSTM and Bi-LSTM methods and the results are compared on the basis of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Additionally, the computational complexity analysis for both algorithms is carried out. For short-term forecasting, hourly data of electrical load is considered. The Bi-LSTM model produced the MAPE of 8.79% while simple LSTM model showed 14.85%. The Bi-LSTM outperformed the conventional LSTM model with a margin of 6% MAPE overall. However, the computational time of LSTM model was short, almost 60% of the time taken by the Bi-LSTM model.<br>

2013-2017	Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering<br>
COMSATS Institute of Information Technology, Wah Campus, Pakistan.<br>
CGPA: 3.62/4.0<br>
Project Title: Close loop speed control of three-phase BLDC Motor with Hall sensors<br>
